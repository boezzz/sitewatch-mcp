The strategy includes the creation of the Seattle\u2019s first plain language plan and new approaches to make information and services more accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities and those with limited English. The strategy will support new federal accessibility standards and help prepare the city for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 when Seattle will welcome fans from all over the world.  \u201cClear and accessible public information is a core responsibility of government. Whether it\u2019s emergency updates, navigation around town, resources to help people pay a bill or start a business, or news on a neighborhood program, this effort will make it easier for people to get the information they need to use City services,\u201d said **Mayor Harrell**. \u201cOur administration is committed to advancing good governance and meeting people where they are. Too often, dense, difficult, and frankly indecipherable language can be a barrier to accessing government services. As a City, we can and must do better to reach all of our communities.\u201d  The Executive Order launches three different projects as part of the One Seattle Community Communications Strategy:   * **Digital Accessibility** \u2013 The City\u2019s Information Technology department will lead efforts to ensure that digital communications and online information work for everyone. This includes addressing accessibility needs for people who are blind or low vision. City departments will work together to meet new federal requirements for accessible websites and digital tools. * **Plain Language** \u2013 The Mayor\u2019s Office will create Seattle's first plain language plan. This means writing information in a way that is simple, clear, and easy to understand. By using plain language, the City can make programs, services, and emergency updates more accessible to everyone. It will also speed up translations into Seattle\u2019s many spoken languages and make them more affordable. * **Coordinated Communications** \u2013 The Innovation and Performance team will review communication platforms and tools across all City departments. This will include finding overlaps or gaps and identifying ways to improve. The goal is to improve public communication systems so everyone can find the information they need quickly and easily.

Improving Digital Accessibility In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice updated its regulations under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This requires state and local governments to make their websites and mobile apps accessible to people with disabilities. The new rule mandates compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. This is a standard Seattle had already set as a goal for its City websites. The City will audit its existing websites and content, address accessibility issues, and establish processes for ongoing compliance.  \"I appreciate Mayor Harrell and the City of Seattle making this strong commitment to accessibility and inclusion,\u201d **said Marci Carpenter, President, National Federation of the Blind of Washington**. \u201cAs a member and leader in the National Federation of the Blind I have urged the federal government to adopt the digital accessibility regulations. I am also excited about the potential of the FIFA Games to help bring awareness of the benefits of accessibility in all areas.\u201d Expanding Language Access There are more than 150 languages or dialects spoken by students and their families in Seattle. In the summer of 2026, Seattle will host six FIFA World Cup matches at Lumen Field. This will bring hundreds of thousands of fans from around the world, including many with limited English. The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs leads the City\u2019s [language access](https://seattle.gov/iandraffairs/LA?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) efforts, including the Smartcat translation platform.  \"Soccer unites and excites, and on behalf of the Seattle FIFA World Cup Local Organizing Committee (SeattleFWC26), I am grateful for Mayor Harrell\u2019s commitment to inclusivity and accessibility for all, including those with disabilities or individuals who speak limited English. This commitment to accessibility truly embodies the spirit of Seattle and is another reason this city is such an incredible place to live, work, and play,\u201d said **Peter Tomozawa**, **CEO Seattle FWC26**. \u201cAt SeattleFWC26, we are committed to bringing the World Cup experience to everyone and it is truly inspiring to see our city government embrace the same approach - ensuring equal access, both on and off the pitch, embraces the spirit of Seattle that makes it such an incredible place to live.\" Clear Communication Plain language, defined by the Federal Plain Language Act of 2010, is writing that is clear, concise, and well-organized. Using plain language makes information easy for the intended audience to understand immediately. The City will create a writing style guide, conduct training, and explore new tools like artificial intelligence to update content.

This also builds on a [2017 Executive Order](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Mayor/Burgess-Executive-Order-2017-10-Language-Access.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) to enhance language access as part of Seattle\u2019s commitment to being a welcoming city. What People Are Saying **Rob Lloyd, Chief Technology Officer, City of Seattle**  \u201cTechnology helps overcome barriers to city services for our residents who speak other languages, or who live with disabilities.

Together, we are poised to transform how Seattle communicates, ensuring that every resident, worker, and visitor can easily access and understand our information and services as well as opportunities for civic engagement. This initiative paves the way for a more connected and informed Seattle.\"  **Sam Read, Deputy Director of Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle**  \u201cPrioritizing plain language is important as it ensures that everyone, regardless of their background or literacy level, can access and understand city information. This is at the heart of the City of Seattle Community Liaisons Program, which acts as a bridge between government and historically underrepresented and underserved communities. Our Community Liaisons use plain language to help members of their community understand how to participate in government and feel included.\u201d  **Leslie Morishita, Executive Director, InterimCDA**  \u201cWe work with hundreds of seniors and community members with limited English\u00a0in the CID and beyond, and when information from the city is mistranslated or is difficult to translate it creates real obstacles for people to access the services they need and to participate in a meaningful way, in processes that directly impact their lives. \u00a0Simplifying the language used in city communication will be immensely valuable and we appreciate Mayor Harrell taking the initiative to do this.\u201d  **Brittny Goodsell, Plain Language Expert**, **State of Washington**  \"The City of Seattle's initiative to bring plain language front and center will completely transform the city's work. These writing and design strategies not only improve how well someone can access important information they need to live their lives, but clear writing increases information equity. This practice is always a win, always a home run. And, government entities serve the people of Washington better when they make clear and simple messaging the standard \u2013 not the exception. I applaud the mayor's decision to make plain language a priority.\"  **Alison Cardinal, Ph.D., Assistant Professor Writing Studies, University of Washington**  \u201cLanguage access is not only a fundamental right established by the Civil Rights Act, it\u2019s also a powerful way to address historical injustices. The Mayor\u2019s affirmation of the City of Seattle\u2019s commitment to language access demonstrates Seattle\u2019s dedication to equity for all residents, regardless of language or disability. By considering the needs and preferences of these communities the beginning, not the end, of any communication strategy, the City ensures that all of its residents, regardless of their background, have equal access to the opportunities for their communities\u00a0to\u00a0thrive.\u201d    ### | | |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| |  | | --- | | Office of the Mayor logo - press release version | |\n| |  |  | | --- | --- | | Press ReleaseFor Immediate Release **Contact Information** Ben Dalgetty Email: ben.dalgetty@seattle.gov   |  | | --- | |  |  Mayor Harrell Issues Executive Order to Improve the Accessibility of City Resources and Information **Seattle**\u2013 Today, Mayor Bruce Harrell issued an Executive Order to improve accessibility of information through a One Seattle Community Communications Strategy.

The strategy includes the creation of the Seattle\u2019s first plain language plan and new approaches to make information and services more accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities and those with limited English. The strategy will support new federal accessibility standards and help prepare the city for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 when Seattle will welcome fans from all over the world.  \u201cClear and accessible public information is a core responsibility of government. Whether it\u2019s emergency updates, navigation around town, resources to help people pay a bill or start a business, or news on a neighborhood program, this effort will make it easier for people to get the information they need to use City services,\u201d said **Mayor Harrell**. \u201cOur administration is committed to advancing good governance and meeting people where they are. Too often, dense, difficult, and frankly indecipherable language can be a barrier to accessing government services. As a City, we can and must do better to reach all of our communities.\u201d  The Executive Order launches three different projects as part of the One Seattle Community Communications Strategy:   * **Digital Accessibility** \u2013 The City\u2019s Information Technology department will lead efforts to ensure that digital communications and online information work for everyone. This includes addressing accessibility needs for people who are blind or low vision. City departments will work together to meet new federal requirements for accessible websites and digital tools. * **Plain Language** \u2013 The Mayor\u2019s Office will create Seattle's first plain language plan. This means writing information in a way that is simple, clear, and easy to understand. By using plain language, the City can make programs, services, and emergency updates more accessible to everyone. It will also speed up translations into Seattle\u2019s many spoken languages and make them more affordable. * **Coordinated Communications** \u2013 The Innovation and Performance team will review communication platforms and tools across all City departments. This will include finding overlaps or gaps and identifying ways to improve. The goal is to improve public communication systems so everyone can find the information they need quickly and easily.   Read the [Executive Order](https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/02/Executive-Order-2025-03-Inclusive-Information.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery). Improving Digital Accessibility In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice updated its regulations under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This requires state and local governments to make their websites and mobile apps accessible to people with disabilities. The new rule mandates compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. This is a standard Seattle had already set as a goal for its City websites. The City will audit its existing websites and content, address accessibility issues, and establish processes for ongoing compliance.  \"I appreciate Mayor Harrell and the City of Seattle making this strong commitment to accessibility and inclusion,\u201d **said Marci Carpenter, President, National Federation of the Blind of Washington**. \u201cAs a member and leader in the National Federation of the Blind I have urged the federal government to adopt the digital accessibility regulations. I am also excited about the potential of the FIFA Games to help bring awareness of the benefits of accessibility in all areas.\u201d Expanding Language Access There are more than 150 languages or dialects spoken by students and their families in Seattle. In the summer of 2026, Seattle will host six FIFA World Cup matches at Lumen Field. This will bring hundreds of thousands of fans from around the world, including many with limited English. The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs leads the City\u2019s [language access](https://seattle.gov/iandraffairs/LA?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) efforts, including the Smartcat translation platform.  \"Soccer unites and excites, and on behalf of the Seattle FIFA World Cup Local Organizing Committee (SeattleFWC26), I am grateful for Mayor Harrell\u2019s commitment to inclusivity and accessibility for all, including those with disabilities or individuals who speak limited English. This commitment to accessibility truly embodies the spirit of Seattle and is another reason this city is such an incredible place to live, work, and play,\u201d said **Peter Tomozawa**, **CEO Seattle FWC26**. \u201cAt SeattleFWC26, we are committed to bringing the World Cup experience to everyone and it is truly inspiring to see our city government embrace the same approach - ensuring equal access, both on and off the pitch, embraces the spirit of Seattle that makes it such an incredible place to live.\" Clear Communication Plain language, defined by the Federal Plain Language Act of 2010, is writing that is clear, concise, and well-organized. Using plain language makes information easy for the intended audience to understand immediately. The City will create a writing style guide, conduct training, and explore new tools like artificial intelligence to update content.  The modern plain language movement in government began with a 1998 Executive Memorandum by President Bill Clinton, directing federal agencies to [use plain language](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/WCPD-1998-06-08/pdf/WCPD-1998-06-08-Pg1010.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) so that public communications were clearer and more accessible. In 2023, Governor Jay Inslee issued Washington State\u2019s most recent [Executive Order on plain language](https://governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/23-02%20-%20Plain%20Language.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery).

This also builds on a [2017 Executive Order](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Mayor/Burgess-Executive-Order-2017-10-Language-Access.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) to enhance language access as part of Seattle\u2019s commitment to being a welcoming city.
